                 SECTION B.2:
                 NAVIGATION:
After so much surfing in the internet , I found out that the effetive
way to respond to changes in environment and give correct output
relies on what the control architecture for navigation is selected
and in what proportion.
Hybrid architecture which combines the feature of both
deliberative and reactive architecture is taken with more
proportion of reactive architecture because the reactive model
responds to aptly to the weather uncertainity. The main focus of
reactive model is to behave according to stimuli so there isnâ€™t
much planning here.
